# ml_projects
This repository contains my most recent completed Machine Learning/Data Science/Data Analysis projects 
(along with my written analyses) written in Python, R, or SAS. The Jupyter Notebooks can also be opened up by going 
to https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mldiva/ml_projects/tree/master/, although plots in some of the 
larger analyses may have trouble rendering this way.
